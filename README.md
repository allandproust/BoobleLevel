This was the first app I developed for Android. Don't judge me, it's better than some boring old 'Hello World' app! After a few short days it was downloaded a few tens of thousands of times on the Play Store and was showing serious viral potential in Russia, India, and the US; however, the hype was shortlived as party pooper google speciously banned it from the play store citing sexual content violation...lame.

However not to worry, you can still [download and install the .apk](https://github.com/toadlyBroodle/BoobleLevel/blob/master/app-release1.0.apk), or build the project yourself from this source code.

Once installed, you can play with boobs on your phone! Shake and touch the animated breasts to make the boobs bounce.
