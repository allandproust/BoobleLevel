Bubble level with boobs!

[This app and more here.](https://greenhacker.dev/portfolio/apps/)

This was the first app I developed for Android. Don't judge me, it's better than some boring old 'Hello World' app! After a few short days it was downloaded a few tens of thousands of times on the Play Store and was showing serious viral potential in Russia, India, and the US; however, the hype was shortlived as party pooper google speciously banned it from the play store citing sexual content violation...lame.

However not to worry, you can still download and install the .apk from here.

Once installed, you can play with boobs on your phone! Shake and touch the animated breasts to make the boobs bounce.
